#Duber_Ticket_Demo
The name of the project is Duber.
The main idea is to combine buses and trains so that people can get to their destinations easier and faster. People just need to add some information such as departure, destination, date, and time, and the program will calculate different routes with different buses and trains so that you can choose the one you like. After choosing your route, you will be able to buy the tickets all in the application, you also have the option to exclude any tickets of the route that you don't want to buy.
To code the program we used Kivy and KivyMD Python, so it is necessary to install Kivy, KivyMD and Python to be able to run the code.
