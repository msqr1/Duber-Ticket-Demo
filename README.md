# Duber-Ticket-Demo 
The name of the project is Duber, created for the [Uber Global Hackathon](https://www.virtualglobalhackathon.org) 2023.
Its main idea is to combine uber, buses and trains so that people can get to their destinations easier and faster. People just need to add some information such as departure, destination, date, and time, and the program will calculate different routes with different buses and trains so that you can choose the one you like. After choosing your route, you will be able to buy the tickets all in the application, you also have the option to exclude any tickets of the route that you don't want to buy.
The program is coded in in KivyMD Python.
